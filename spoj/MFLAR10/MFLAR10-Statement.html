<p> Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating poetical form. Tautograms are a special case alliteration, which is the occurrence of the same letter at the beginning of adjacent words. In particular, a sentence is a tautogram if all of its words start with the same letter.  </p> 
<p> For instance, the following sentences are tautograms: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Flowers Flourish from France</li> 
 <li>Sam Simmonds speaks softly</li> 
 <li>Peter pIckEd pePPers</li> 
 <li>truly tautograms triumph</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Fiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this kind of sentences. Please help Fiona to check if each sentence she wrote down is a tautogram or not.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p> Each test case is given in a single line that contains a sentence. A sentence consists of a sequence of at most 50 words separated by single spaces. A word is a sequence of at most 20 contiguous uppercase and lowercase letters from the English alphabet. A word contains at least one letter and a sentence contains at least one word. </p> 
<p> The last test case is followed by a line containing only a single character ‘<tt>*</tt>’ (asterisk). </p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p> For each test case output a single line containing an uppercase ‘<tt>Y</tt>’ if the sentence is a tautogram, or an uppercase ‘<tt>N</tt>’ otherwise. </p>
